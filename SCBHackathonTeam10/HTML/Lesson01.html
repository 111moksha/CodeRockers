            <p>So champion, let us start with the quite boring part, the history of HTML.
                HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language, the most widely used Web language to develop web pages. HTML
                was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML specification, which
                was published in 1995.
                HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is
                widely used currently we are having the HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this
                version was published in 2012.
                <br>HTML is super easy to learn - You will enjoy it!
